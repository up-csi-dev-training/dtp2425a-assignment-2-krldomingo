"girl, so rhymey"
by me :]



i'm sitting here
cramming a poem
in the bottom bunk
'cause kuya's not home

wondering if
i should just take
an existing poem
for time's sake

not much of it left
it's down to the wire
"this is fine"
but everything's on fire

yet here i am
writing a poem
resisting the urge
to open my phone

earlier today
i was just thinking
of charli xcx's
"girl, so confusing"

i feel inspired
by the way she writes:
very train-of-thought,
very honest and wise

and still here i go
trying to rhyme my poem
i actually don't know why
it's not like charli did either
